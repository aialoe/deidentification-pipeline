This deidentification pipeline updates a named entity recognizer (NER) with labelled data from [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano). At AI-ALOE, we are developing and testing systems to obfuscate personally identifiable information (PII) from student-generated texts. The only requirement is a json lines file in the "assets" directory with labelled PII.

We have plans to extend this system using weak supervision with [skweak](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skweak). We also want to  integrate our spaCy pipeline with [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/), which will allow us to evaluate and combine predictions more effectively.

[`spacy project`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project) CLI. To find out
more about a command, add `--help`. For detailed instructions, see the
[usage guide](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

1. **Clone** the project.
   ```bash
   python -m spacy project clone --repo https://github.com/aloe/deidentification-pipeline
   ```
2. **Run a command** defined in the `project.yml`.
   ```bash
   python -m spacy project run init
   ```
3. **Run a workflow** of multiple steps in order.
   ```bash
   python -m spacy project run all
   ```
